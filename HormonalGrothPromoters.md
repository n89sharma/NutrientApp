* [Opinion of scientific panel ... hormone residues in bovine meat and meat products](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.510/epdf)
  * "Most of these commercial products contain different combinations of the natural hormones, oestradiol, testosterone 
    and progesterone, and the three synthetic compounds, trenbolone (which predominantly binds to the androgen 
    receptor), zeranol (which binds to oestrogen receptors), and melengestrol (which resembles natural receptor)."

  * "GPHs are normally used only in the growing (pre-pubertal) period in male, neutered or female animals that are 
    intended for slaughter. Hence, potential adverse effects on the reproductive capacity of the target animals, 
    effects on milk composition, and the excretion of administered hormones in milk need not be considered."

  * "...it is necessary to maintain the permanent prohibition laid down in Directive 96/22/EC on Oestradiol 17&beta; 
  and to continue **provisionally** to apply the prohibition to the other five hormones..."  
  * "...as concerns excess intake of hormone residues and their metabolites, and in view of the intrinsic properties
   of hormones and the epidemiological findings, a risk to the consumer has been identified with different levels of 
   conclusive evidence for the six hormones evaluated."
